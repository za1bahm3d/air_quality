This project focuses on analyzing **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)** pollution levels in **Aberdeen** using data collected from a **roadside monitoring station** throughout the year **2024**. The aim is to explore how NO₂ levels fluctuate **daily** and **seasonally** to identify key pollution trends and recommend strategies to mitigate air quality issues.

**Research Questions**

1. **How do nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels vary throughout the day near roadside monitoring stations?**
2. **How do seasonal changes affect NO₂ pollution levels?**
